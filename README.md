Investment memos for Root Ventures deals

Many companies end up very differently from how they started, but this repo shows why we invested when we did. Maybe it will provide a bit of insight into how we think if you're considering working with us.

Some things have to be edited/redacted, particularly around personal references and diligence, pricing, and any information about the company or product that would be of competitive interest. But otherwise, we're trying to stay true to our original thinking. As things change with the company, as inevitably they will, it's likely you'll see us talking about their new stuff on Twitter or around the web.
